# Game Theory of Societal Dynamics

This is the code that goes with the paper [Apparent Strength Conceals Instability in a Model for the Collapse of Historical States](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096523#pone-0096523-g003) by Daniel Lawson and Neeraj Oak, published in PLOS ONE in 2014.

At present there is a basic example working that replicates Figure 2, and a robust implementation that can be used to work on the extensions from Figure 3. However code to generate this is currently absent.

This repository and all code are released as GPL-v3. Please attribute but otherwise go ahead and reuse. We'd love to hear about anything interesting you can do with the code.
